#Team Agreement


* Communication method: Discord
* Expected response time: 1-2 days
* Nature and Frequency of meetings during development = Weekly/Biweekly
* Contingency Plan: 
   * Some teammate(s) not being able to complete their (scheduled?) task on time
      * Message everyone in the Discord group chat
      * Can ask to delegate task to others or ask for extension
         * Case (i) Others can react to message with thumbs up if they can help take over
            * Teammate can help take over their task in later weeks
         * Case (ii) Give a heads up on X # of days of extension






(Question: For the thumbs up part of case i, is this a better alternative for record keeping: the group member who is willing to help with the task can reply the message - “I can take over task XXX”)
* Yeah. this is nice


(Question: “Ideally, these meetings should occur daily, with a minimum requirement of three
meetings per week.”)
